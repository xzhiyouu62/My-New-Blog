This theme was developed during my free time, and the documentation may not be comprehensive enough, but I will try my best to explain it.

### Prerequisite

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed in your development environment:

- :link[Node.js]{id=https://nodejs.org/en/download} - Required for running the development environment.
- :link[pnpm]{id=https://pnpm.io/installation} - Our preferred package manager for dependency management.
- :link[Git]{id=https://git-scm.com/} - For version control and project management.
- :link[VS Code]{id=https://code.visualstudio.com/} - Recommended code editor with excellent development experience.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have other alternative tools, then you don't need to follow the recommendations in this article.

### Startup project

There are two ways to do this:

- :link[Fork the repository]{id=https://github.com/Dnzzk2/Litos/fork}
- :link[Use this template]{id=https://github.com/Dnzzk2/Litos/generate} - In the future, content-free branches will be launched, which do not require deleting and replacing content.

After you have your own repository, you can clone it to your local machine.

### End

The following documents will be divided into pages, such as readme, posts...
